# IBP-workshop-unicamp

Welcome to the Workshop on **Data Analysis Strategies for Single-Cell Image-Based Profiling**, a hands-on training designed to equip researchers with essential skills for image-based single-cell data processing and analysis. Across three days, participants will learn foundational principles, segmentation and feature extraction techniques, and downstream single-cell data analysis. We will use Fiji, ImageJ Macro script language, Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
